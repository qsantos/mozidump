# MozIDump

Extract the contents of Firefoxâ€™s IndexedDB into JSON format.

This is inspired by ntninjaâ€™s [`moz-idb-edit`](https://gitlab.com/ntninja/moz-idb-edit), itself inspried from a [Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54920939/parsing-fb-puritys-firefox-idb-indexed-database-api-object-data-blob-from-lin).

Also, this is ðŸ’« blazingly fast ðŸš€ because it is written in Rust ðŸ¦€.
While the Python version takes about 34â€¯s to extract the data I care about, this program does the same in 340â€¯ms.
This results in a 184â€¯MB JSON file, so a very rough calculation gives a throughput of 500â€¯MB/s.
